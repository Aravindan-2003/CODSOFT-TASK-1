# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION


This Titanic survival prediction project is a classic data science and machine learning task that aims to predict which passengers aboard the Titanic would survive the disaster based on various attributes. The Titanic dataset typically includes information such as passenger class, age, sex, ticket fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, and cabin number.

The ultimate goal of the Titanic survival prediction project is to build a model that accurately predicts the survival outcomes of passengers based on their characteristics, thereby gaining insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. Additionally, it serves as a pedagogical exercise for learning data science and machine learning techniques.
